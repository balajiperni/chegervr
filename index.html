    <h1> CHE GUEVARA</h1>
    <h3>--LIGHT FOR THE DARK</h3>
   <div class="text">
    Ernesto "Che" Guevara (Spanish:  14 June 1928[1] 9 October 1967) was an
     Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat,
      and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized 
      visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global 
      insignia in popular culture.

     As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America 
     and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed.
    His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist
    exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his involvement 
    in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, whose eventual 
    CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidified
     Guevara's political ideology.
   Later in Mexico City, Guevara met Raúl and
   Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and sailed to Cuba aboard 
   the yacht Granma with the intention of overthrowing US-backed dictator Fulgencio
    Batista. Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted 
    to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role
 in the two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.
 After the Cuban Revolution, Guevara played key roles in the new
  government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads
   for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary 
   tribunals,[9] instituting agrarian land reform as minister of 
   industries, helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy
    campaign, serving as both president of the National Bank and
     instructional director for Cuba's armed forces, and traversing
      the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. 
      Such positions also allowed him to play a central role
       in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay 
       of Pigs Invasion, and bringing Soviet nuclear-armed
ballistic missiles to Cuba, which preceded the 1962
     Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, Guevara was
      a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal
         guerrilla warfare manual, along with a best-selling 
         memoir about his youthful continental motorcycle journey.
          His experiences and studying of MarxismLeninism led
           him to posit that the Third World's underdevelopment
            and dependence was an intrinsic result of 
            imperialism, neocolonialism, and monopoly 
            capitalism, with the only remedies
             being proletarian internationalism and
              world revolution. Guevara left Cuba in 
              1965 to foment continental revolutions 
              across both Africa and South America,
               first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa
                and later in Bolivia, where he was 
                captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian
                 forces and summarily executed.

           <h3>SPEECH OF CHE GUEVARA IN UK</h3>
                 
        </div>
       
        
       
        In early 1965, Guevara went to Africa to offer his knowledge 
        and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing conflict in the
         Congo. According to Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella,
          Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism's weak link 
          and so had enormous revolutionary potential.
           Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had
            fraternal relations with Che since his 1959 
            visit, saw Guevara's plan to fight in Congo as
             "unwise" and warned that he would become a "Tarzan" 
             figure, doomed to failure.[219] Despite the warning,
              Guevara traveled to Congo using the alias Ramón 
              Benítez. He led the Cuban operation in support of
               the leftist Simba movement, which had emerged 
               from the ongoing Congo conflict. Guevara, his
                second-in-command Víctor Dreke, and 12 other 
                Cuban expeditionaries arrived in Congo on
                 24 April 1965, and a contingent of approximately
                  100 Afro-Cubans joined them soon afterward.
                   For a time, they collaborated with guerrilla
             leader Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who had helped
             supporters of the overthrown prime minister
             Patrice Lumumba to lead an unsuccessful revolt months 
             earlier. As an admirer of the late Lumumba,
              Guevara declared that his "murder should be a 
              lesson for all of us". Guevara, with limited 
              knowledge of Swahili and the local languages, 
              was assigned a teenage interpreter, Freddy Ilanga. 
              Over the course of seven months, Ilanga grew to 
              "admire the hard-working Guevara", who "showed
               the same respect to black people as he did to whites".
                Guevara soon became disillusioned with the poor
                 discipline of Kabila's troops and later dismissed
                him, stating "nothing leads me to believe he is the
                 man of the hour".[225] Regardless, Che still
                  regarded Kabila more favorably than other Simba 
                  leaders, several of whom still pretended to 
                  lead rebel forces even after they had fled into exile.
           
             <h2> DEATH</h2>

             <p>
             In October 1967 the guerrilla group that Che Guevara was 
             leading in Bolivia was nearly annihilated by a special 
             detachment of the Bolivian army aided by CIA advisers.
              Wounded, Guevara was captured and then shot dead. 
              Before he was secretly buried, his hands were cut 
              off so that his fingerprints could be used to confirm
               his identity.
               Che Guevara was secretly buried after he was 
               killed in Bolivia in 1967, but in 1997 a 
               skeleton that was believed to be his and 
               the remains of six of his comrades were
                disinterred from a mass grave near Vallegrande,
                 Bolivia, transported to Cuba, and reinterred in
                  a memorial and monument in Santa Clara.
